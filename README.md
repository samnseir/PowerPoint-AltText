## How to use
### Get
- Will get the Alt Text from the current open/active presentation, and if none are open, it will prompt you to select a presentation.
- Conditional Formatting:
  - Red = missing Alt Text
  - Yellow = autogenerated Alt Text
- Once the filename and path are present, then it will open and use that file.

### Update
- Add the new Alt Text in the second table - ensure it is entered/pasted as it correlates to the first table.
- You do not need to enter/paste the new Alt Text for every shape/image - you can add new Alt Text for one or more shapres (the script will skip empty or non-changed Alt Text).
- You can also change the Title and this will also be updated.
- After doing an update, do a get to see the new changes come through.
- After the update, you will need to save the presentation. You can also Undo in PowerPoint to revert the changes.
